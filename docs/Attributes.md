This page is a guide to the design principles of the attributes.

While generally sticking to the DnD style of strength dex etc. I want to add a layer of depth by abstracting away from the common names for these, and as a result giving them broader applications.

**WHATEVER IT IS IT SHOULD TIE INTO THE SETTING**

One idea I have for this is mapping attributes to personality traits.

Discipline - Constitution
Anxiety - Dexterity
Sociability - Charisma
Neuroticism - Intelligence

Maybe body part / charka shit

Mind - int
Heart - con
soul - loyalty
