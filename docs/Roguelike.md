A traditional Roguelike conceived of all my disappointment and anger from other roguelikes.

### Main Focus
The main focus, and subsequently issue I have with most roguelikes, is strangely enough, not enough replayability. I feel as if most traditional roguelikes funnel to a very simple gameplay loop with progression, then get stale as every run devolves to the same loop of walking into enemies until they disappear, and getting no useful loot since you're overpowered. So, to combat this feeling I want to focus on combat, and variety in combat situations. First, I want classes to have much more unique playstyles than other roguelikes, where [[Classes]] mostly just dictate some starting gear and which weapon you'll be using. 

Additionally, to add even more run variance (with bonus player agency), a Deep woken style system, where after a certain number of levels you can pick from a selection of random skills of that level and below, so that in every build you wont always have every skill in that class. Like how a skill tree forces decision, just without being able to predict the future. 


For less combat oriented skills, tie some skills to starting classes, but make most of them learnable through quests.
